I am a machine laerning engineer working on a file Tree_Species.csv. Data sample from this file looks like the following: X,Y,OBJECTID,SiteID,Address,Street,OnStreet,FromStreet,ToStreet,SideOfParcel,Site,Species,DiameterAtBreastHeight,GrowSpace,Trunks,Height,Width,TreeCategory,Area,Parks,BotanicalName,CommonName

Utilize the data given in 'Tree_Species.csv' file, conduct a PCA on the tree_species (DiameterAtBreastHeight, Height, Width) and plot the first two principal components in a scatter plot, color-coded by Species. Add vector lines to show the original dimensions. Use Python libraries to generate code.
